2026-07-23 Project approved by owner: name=Emberdelve, mechanic=dice-builder, private repo, free+$3.99-4.99 unlock. Research synthesis drove spec/architecture (5-track swarm, verified).
2026-07-23 Repo created (tapiwamakandigona/emberdelve, private). Foundation scaffolded: state files, spec, architecture, sealed sim core (rng/combat/dispatch), 12-test headless suite, CI (Lua test gate -> bob.jar 1.13.0 debug APK).
2026-07-23 CI iteration: bob rejects bundle output under build/ (reserved dir) -> moved to dist/bundle. Fine-grained PAT pushes do NOT trigger push workflows; dispatch manually via `gh workflow run CI --ref main`.
2026-07-23 Repo flipped PUBLIC temporarily: GitHub Actions blocked on private repo (billing). Safe: zero licensed assets, all own code. Flip back private once owner fixes Actions billing or a public compile repo is set up.
2026-07-23 M0 COMPLETE. CI run 29990121111 fully green: test job (12/12) + build-android (bob 1.13.0, JDK 25) -> debug APK artifact 89150834647 (arm64-v8a+armeabi-v7a, 29.6MB, verified structure). features M0-1..M0-5 passes=true with evidence.
2026-07-23 DEVICE SMOKE TEST PASSED: owner installed M0 debug APK on their Android phone; screen shows seed 20260723, phase victory, events 31, hash 158933364 == golden event_hash from CI. Sim core bit-identical on-device. Owner instruction: "it opened, continue" -> M1 green-lit.
